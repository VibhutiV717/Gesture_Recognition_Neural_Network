# Gesture Recognition Using Neural Networks

This project is a deep learning-based gesture recognition system that uses video input to classify hand gestures. The model is built using Conv3D and Conv2D+LSTM architectures to capture both spatial and temporal features in gesture sequences.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Python
- TensorFlow & Keras
- OpenCV
- Conv3D, LSTM
- NumPy, Matplotlib

## 📌 Objective
To develop a model that can detect and classify different hand gestures from video frames for use in real-time interaction systems.

## 📁 Project Structure
- `gesture_recognition.ipynb` – Main notebook with model building and evaluation
- `README.md` – Project description and tools used
- Data was sourced from course material and includes pre-processed video sequences
